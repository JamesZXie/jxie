				<h1>The systems design was created upon request for Smithfield Foods, which was having a tough time managing hog waste.</h1>
				<p style="border-left: solid #d1e5c5;">	
					Smithfield is the world’s largest pork producer, and as such, it’s expected for them to have quite a lot of pigs. The more pigs you have in an area, and the faster they grow, the more waste is produced - quite obvious. However, in the past years Smithfield had neglected to pay attention to waste management, only focusing on maximizing their factory farming potential. This resulted in policies that further concentrated and boosted the growth of their livestock, causing huge spikes in the amount of waste their system had to process.
					<br><br>
					Their current system is a wet management system, which uses liquids in the transfer, treatment, and storage of the waste. The hog excrement is flushed into a central lagoon, where it is mixed in with a few chemicals and then passively processed over time. The processed fluid is then pumped and sprayed over fields as fertilizer. As a result, when it rains, the water fills up the lagoon, and the only way to lower water levels is to spray the fluids over fields as fertilizer. Due to the rain, however, the ground becomes highly saturated and the fertilizer can slide right off and into local surface or ground water reserves, costing Smithfield tens of thousands in fines. 
					<br><br>
					We designed a dry waste management system with the objective being minimized costs. This meant taking contracts, transportation, equipment maintenance, and installation fees into account while doing cost calculations. We settled on using as much from the sites that they already possessed as possible, such as modifying an interior waste scraper system to transport waste longer distances and using it for transportation outside of barns. The crown jewel of the design, however was actually our most expensive piece: an anaerobic biogas digester. We discovered that including a digester would be allow us to convert most of the waste to electricity while treating it. After interviewing a few suppliers and industry experts, we decided it was a viable addition and although a bit pricey, was worth the investment.
				</p>
				<h2>The final system design would reduce waste volume by 20% and eliminate over 90% of toxic runoff.</h2>
				<p style="border-left: solid #d1e5c5;">
					The system cost around 1.5 million per site for installation, but the energy generated from the biogas digester let the system pay itself over 16 years, even without taking the money saved from lawsuits into account. Unfortunately, Smithfield decided that the risk for installing a dry system was too much, given the large initial investment. They are currently looking to reduce the volume of waste through purifying some of the liquid volume in the excrement.
