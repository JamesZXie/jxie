					 Of course, SamPolls are not nearly as specific, as they're designed to be very simple questions to help representatives get a pulse on constituent opinion while formulating their own positions on issues. The time required for the same number of constituents to answer a SamPoll versus a traditional poll more than halved, and takes constituents only a fraction of the time to complete. While ultimately not a viable platform due to the requirement of a high percentage of community downloads, the project revealed a few key insights, the most significant being simplifying the polling questions, cutting out the middleman, and humanizing representatives increases the response rate and overall political inclusion of a community.
