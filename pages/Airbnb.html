				<h1>The redesign was a personal side project inspired by a friend's mistake</h1> 

				<p style="border-left: solid #FD5C63;">
					The redesign came about when a friend accidentally mistook some information on his Airbnb booking, and had to rebook last minute. Unfortunately, different specifics with the new listing information also failed to catch his eye, and the event was ultimately abandoned halfway.
				</p>
				<p style="border-left: solid #FD5C63;">
					After taking a look at the site myself, his mistakes were slightly more understandable: the information screen was basically a wall of text. Of course, this makes sense in context; external studies show that most of Airbnb's customers make the bulk of their decision based on listing location and price. 
					Given this, it makes sense to prioritize the convenience of the hosts on the information listing screen, sacrificing UI/UX on the guest side for the sake of convenience on the host side.
				</p>
				<p style="border-left: solid #FD5C63;">
					However, I felt that there had to be a better way to organize the information in a general-enough way that would still make it easy for hosts to put up listings. The key, in my opinion, was to first group the information better, then 
					present it in a more modular fashion.
