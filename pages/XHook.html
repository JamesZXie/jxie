				<h1>The X Hook was made for Feinberg, which wanted to help a patient with a paralyzed arm crochet again.</h1>
				<p style="border-left: solid #4F2582">
					The problem here is straightforward: not being able to grip a crochet hook or move it makes positioning the second arm tricky. However, as we dug further we began to find that there were actually a few home remedies for the issue. All of them involved sticking the hook into some kind of object- Styrofoam, wood, a pillow- and manipulating the second hand around the object. 
					<br><br>
					I learned the basics of crocheting and tested out a few of the options. They all worked, but were clunky and uncomfortable, as most solutions required me to rest after only a few minutes. The biggest issue was that the angle of the object was stiff, and thus the hook with it, requiring my second arm to move up and down almost half a foot per stitch. 
					<br><br>
					We ended up taking inspiration from the Xbox controller, which allows the protruding joysticks to move in all directions, while giving it resistance back towards the center. Using a wooden base, we attached a spring with high resistance to the base of a crochet hook as seen above. We then modified the neck and the base to allow for more natural movement, as well as velcro footing for adjustable height.
				</p>
				<h2>The resulting product, the XHook, was initially a bit clunky and awkward to use, but with practice the experience became much easier than any of the home remedies.</h2>
				<p style="border-left: solid #4F2582">
					Moreover, we were able to mimic the path of a hand crocheting without using any electrical elements, making for a very cheap and easily customizable product. The biggest disadvantage was the time taken to get accustomed to it, as it took us around a week to get ready for the demo. It was a success, and after our final presentation we ended up receiving the best design in class award.
