			I’m James, a CS major at Northwestern University. Just a little bit about me: I have a wide range of interests apart from the obvious two stated on the front page, including dance, adventure, and fashion. If you’re looking for a conversation starter, ask me about all the times I’ve almost died... 
			<br><br>
			Other than that, I prefer to let my work and personality speak for itself (and I know you’d probably prefer to not read a bunch of fluff). <b>That's why part of the greeting is covering this text- I feel that in the end what I say about myself shouldn't really matter.</b> I'd love to talk if you're interested though, so shoot me an email or a message if you want to get to know me better! If not, thanks for checking my site out anyways.
			<br><br>
			If you’re looking to make a request for a merch design, my email is in the contact page :)
			<br><br>
			- Cheers
