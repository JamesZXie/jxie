			I’m James, a CS major at Northwestern University. Just a little bit about me: I have a wide range of interests apart from the obvious two stated on the front page, including dance, adventure, and fashion. If you’re looking for a conversation starter, ask me about all the times I’ve almost died! 
			<br><br>
			Other than that, I prefer to let my work and personality speak for itself (and I know you’d probably prefer not to read a bunch of fluff). That's why part of the greeting is covering this text- it really doesn’t matter. Shoot me an email or a message if you’re interested in getting to know me better, I’d love to talk! If not, thanks for checking my site out anyways.
			<br><br>
			If you’re looking to hire me for a merch design, my email is in the contact page :)
			<br><br>
			- Cheers
