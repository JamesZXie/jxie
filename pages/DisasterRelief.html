				<h1>Disaster Relief was designed as a response to the many crises in late 2017 such as Hurricane Harvey and the California fires.</h1>
				<p style="border-left: solid #fff9ae;">
					Volunteers have a hard time finding work without going through an organization, regardless of the difficulty of the work they're looking to handle. As a result, when it comes to large quantities of smaller issues, such as a looking for missing pets, requests for specific construction tools, etc. it’s tough for organizations to handle. Crowdsourced volunteering tends to be a more effective method; for example, asking your neighbors to borrow a cup of sugar is easier than submitting a request to the Red Cross.
				<br><br>
					To tackle this issue, we began by looking at platforms that currently organize in local areas. By taking the strengths of platforms like NextDoor that had similar functions, we created a service that allowed for simple collaboration on localized relief efforts. Those in need send out a request, which shows up on the global map to volunteers in their area. The requests are segmented by subject, location, severity, and category, categories split into food requests, repair supplies requests, etc.
				<br><br>
					During testing, we prioritized testing with users that were less accustomed to modern technology and user interfaces, as we found that a large portion of community volunteers are above the age of 50, presumably those with more time. As a result, we ended up simplifying a good portion of our UI/UX, feeding information to users in bite-sized chunks instead of shortening the process.
				</p>
				<h2>Ultimately, Disaster Relief aims to cut out the middleman and organize results into a filterable, user-friendly database that prioritizes location so volunteers can take tasks closest to them.</h2>
				<p style="border-left: solid #fff9ae;">
					Testing the final prototype revealed that the three most important factors volunteers consider in choosing to take a task is location, category, and severity. Location is the most important consideration as its perceived to most greatly inconvenience the volunteer. Category comes next, as volunteers are more likely to help if they already have an excess of what’s requested. Severity only serves to tip the scales when it comes to the small requests that our platform aimed at helping.
