				<h1>SamPoll began as a Facebook-sponsored design project on expediting the democratic process throughout the 2016 election.</h1> 

				<p style="border-left: solid #FF10A9;">
					The 2016 election was a rapid series of controversies and controversial topics. Everyone was mad: Republicans at party leadership or at Trump voters, Trump voters at anything Trump denounced, Democrats at party leadership and anything Bernie denounced – it was a time of zero compromise. Even with all these strong emotions, however, it seemed nobody wanted to look at the political system for help. In fact, election participation dropped yet again this year, bringing the assumption that “people don’t vote because they don’t care” into scrutiny.
					<br><br>
					So why aren’t people utilizing the system’s resources to engage in political activity? We started by looked at increasing grassroots activism, but after a few weeks of research we began to realize that a bigger issue was that activists have a hard time being heard. The political system is outdated. Communication between representatives and constituents is monstrously slow relative to how the rest of the world communicates, causing it to stagnate. In fact, according to a Stanford study the average representative falsely gauges constituent support for any policy by around <b>20 percent</b>. In most cases, this is significant enough to tip the scales in favor of policies that otherwise would not have become implemented.
					<br><br>
					After interviewing and testing a paper prototype with Doug Kim from the Belmont City Council and Alejandro from the Berkeley City Council, we concluded that the communication gap was real, and large enough to warrant seeking a proper solution. We continued to iterate and test over the course of the six-month project, ultimately moving off of a Facebook-based feature to make coordination between representatives and constituents easier.
					The end service was a separate social media platform for neighborhoods that keeps users informed of news closer to home, generally focusing around less controversial, relevant issues. SamPolls are mixed in with normal posts, news links, and event posts that highlighted issues surrounding a community. Representatives are allowed to make the polls and contact constituents directly over messenger, helping their constituents stay active and informed.
				</p>

				<h2>Our tests on users put the average response rate to SamPolls at just under 30%, topping three times the 9.5% national response rate to traditional polls.</h2>

				<p style="border-left: solid #FF10A9;">
					 Of course, SamPolls are not nearly as specific, as they're designed to be very simple questions to help representatives get a pulse on constituent opinion while formulating their own positions on issues. The time required for the same number of constituents to answer a SamPoll versus a traditional poll more than halved, and takes constituents only a fraction of the time to complete. While ultimately not a viable platform due to the requirement of a high percentage of community downloads, the project revealed a few key insights, the most significant being simplifying the polling questions, cutting out the middleman, and humanizing representatives increases the response rate and overall political inclusion of a community.
